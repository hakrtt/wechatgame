# TODO(nduca): Add basic unit test for cros_browser_finder.
#
# Here, we should mock the cros_interface module (assuming its working) and
# verify that the finder does the right thing. Because the finder delegates most
# of its work to the CRI, the test code here is going to be comparatively
# simple.
